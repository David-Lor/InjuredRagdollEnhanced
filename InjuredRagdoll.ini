/* INJURED RAGDOLL SCRIPT configuration file
by EnforcerZhukov - http://www.enforcerzhukov.xyz
------------------------------------------
On each category, we got different groups of options, depending on our character's health status:
-Armor options: when our character still has body armor (the blue bar)
-Health options: when our character hasn't got armor (just the green/red bar)
This allows to configure diferent times and ragdoll animations, depending on if our character still has armor or not.
